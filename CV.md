# About
I’m a person that is self motivated every time there is a challenge.
I really like to work in open and transparent teams where we can
work together to search for solutions. Although the details are quite
interesting I always look for the big picture, that way I can have an
overview of the system and understand how I can organize and
optimize all the pieces of the puzzle.
I’m always focused on improving and automating everything
related with the development process and the system architecture,
guaranteeing system availability, scalability and reliability. I always
try to learn and acquire new skills, so I found very interesting the
opportunity to integrate new technologies or tools in the system
whenever bring business or technology advantage.
I’m a father, a husband, a son, a brother, a friend and I always find
time for sightseeing, sports and cooking.
